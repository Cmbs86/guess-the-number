# Guess The Number

A simple vanilla JavaScript game where you guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. This project was inspired by a Udemy class and includes several enhancements beyond the original tutorial.

## Features

- **Basic Game Mechanics**: Guess the number and see if youâ€™re correct!
- **Enhanced User Interface**: Added visual feedback and improved styling.
- **Red Background on No Input**: When the input field is empty and the "Check!" button is pressed, the background turns red.
- **Dark and Light Mode**: Toggle between dark and light themes using a button. Your preference is saved and applied on page reload.
